            <p>Consultants (often referred to as management consultants) help organisations manage change and solve problems so they operate more efficiently and therefore profitably. 

                Consultants offer advice and expertise to client organisations to help them improve their business performance. Their work can focus on operations, strategy, management, IT, finance, marketing, HR and supply chain management across a wide range of industries and specialisms. As they work closely with clients, they may have to work on site or meet representatives from client organisations regularly.</p>
